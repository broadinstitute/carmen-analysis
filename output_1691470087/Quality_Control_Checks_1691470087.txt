1. Evaluation of No Detect Control (NDC) Contamination 

Since none of the NDCs ran in this experiment appear positive after thresholding against the NTC, we posit that there is likely no NDC contamination.
Please be advised to check the output files as well.


2. Evaluation of Combined Positive Control (CPC) Validity 

After thresholding against the NTC, CPC2 appears negative for the following assay(s): no-crRNA, no-crRNA.

In the list provided above, if any of the CPCs show a negative result for an assay that is not the 'no-crRNA' negative control, then that particular assay should be considered invalid for this experiment.
Please be advised to check the output files as well.


3. Evaluation of Human Samples for the Internal Control (RnaseP) 

Warning: First verify that your experiment included a RNaseP assay. If yes, proceed to the following RNaseP analysis.

After thresholding against the NTC, rnasep appears negative for the following sample(s): H20-311-8901, H20-311-9041, H20-311-9284, H20-311-9335, H20-311-9336, H20-311-9340, H20-311-9387, H20-311-9484, H20-311-9528, H20-314-6425, H20-315-8427, H20-315-8473, H20-315-8529, H20-315-8532, H20-321-7305, H20-326-9173, H20-326-9241, H20-326-9263, H20-326-9301, H20-327-0894, H20-327-0903, H20-327-0912, H20-327-0914, H20-327-0918, H20-327-0921, H20-327-0932, H20-327-0934, H20-327-0949, H20-327-0965, H20-327-0983, H20-327-1001, H20-327-1003, H20-327-1008, H20-335-0272, H20-335-0288, H20-335-0341, H20-335-0354, H20-350-6408, H20-350-6502, H20-350-6546, NDC1, NDC2, NTC  1, NTC2, NTC3, NTC4, NTC5, NTC6, NULL1, NULL7.

There are a few different reasons that a sample tests negative for RNaseP:

   (1) If the sample is negative for all assays (including RNaseP), then the most plausible hypothesis is that the viral extraction protocol used in this experiment needs to be examined. For optimal results, the extraction must be compatible with the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) advised by the CARMEN team in the Sabeti Lab.
   ** Note: If the sample is negative for RNaseP and ALL other crRNA assays tested in this experiment, the sample should be rendered invalid.

   (2) If the sample is negative for RNaseP BUT positive for any other viral crRNA assay (excluding RNaseP or no-crRNA), then the most plausible hypothesis is that the sampleâ€™s viral titer may be too high compared to its RNaseP titer. This, thereby, renders the system possibly unable to detect RNaseP, leading to the sample testing negative for RNaseP.
   ** Note: If the sample is negative for RNaseP but positive for any other viral crRNA assay (excluding RNaseP or no-crRNA) tested in this experiment, the sample can still be included in the final results.

   (3) The source sample may have insufficient material, leading to a negative RNaseP signal and an invalid sample result.

4. Evaluation of No Target Control (NTC) Contamination 

The raw fluorescence signal for each NTC sample across all crRNA assays tested in this experiment appears to be within the normal range of 0.1 and 0.4 a.u. Risk of NTC contamination is low.
